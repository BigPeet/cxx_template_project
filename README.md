# C/C++ Template Project

This project aims to serve as a starting point for my C/C++ projects.

The CMake configuration is heavily based on/inspired by [Jason Turner's CMake Template](https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/cmake_template).

## Goals

* An initial directory layout (app, lib, tests, etc.)
* CMake configuration
    * Standard and Language
    * Sanitizers
    * Tests
    * Warnings
    * Options
    * Dependencies
    * Toolchains
* Makefile
* clang-tidy, clangd and clang-format configuration
* CI workflows (Github Actions and/or Gitlab config)
